# Banking Loan Risk Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer data to find patterns and create interactive dashboards. I worked with MySQL database, Python for data cleaning, and Power BI for visualization.

## Tools I Used
- **MySQL** - Database management
- **Python** - Data cleaning and processing
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Code environment
- **Power BI** - Dashboard creation

## My Workflow
1. Created database tables in MySQL
2. Connected MySQL to Jupyter Notebook using Python
3. Cleaned the data and fixed errors
4. Created two clean datasets: `customers_cleaned` and `customers_agg`
5. Loaded the cleaned data back into MySQL
6. Connected Power BI to MySQL database
7. Built interactive dashboards in Power BI

## Key Findings
 Achieved about to 13.17 % loan risk churn rate.
